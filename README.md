 * ''cc_areas.shp'': areas used for crater counts
 * ''cc_craters_gt4km.shp'': craters with diameters greater than 4 chilometers.

 * areas_gt4km.shp
 * 

In the data/crater_counts folder, there are the Craterstats2 file.

### Geologic Map files

 * geo_units.shp 
 * geo_contact.shp
 * geo_units_centroids.shp
 * line_feature.shp
 * point_feature.shp
 * surface_feature.shp
